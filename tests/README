The tests are organized in different categories:

    syntax/bad/     refused by lexical or syntactic analysis
    typing/bad/     refused by semantic analysis
    typing/good/    accepted by semantic analysis
    exec-fail/      compiled with success but the execution have to fail
    exec/           compiled and executed with success, the expected result 
                    being the same as .out

The tests are cumulative i.e.

- the files from typing/bad/, exec-fail/ and exec/ can be used for the category
  syntax/good/

- the files from exec-fail/ and exec/ can be used for the category typing/good/
